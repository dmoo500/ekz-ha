# EKZ Home Assistant Integration (HACS)

This integration allows you to import and analyze EKZ electricity meter data directly in Home Assistant. It is installable via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and supports automatic assignment of devices and entities per installation ID.

## Installation via HACS

1. Open HACS and select "Custom Repositories".
2. Add this GitHub repository (`https://github.com/dmoo500/ekz-ha`) as a custom repository (type: Integration).
3. Search for "EKZ" and install the integration.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Add the integration via the user interface and enter your credentials.

## How it works
- For each EKZ installation ID, a separate device is created.
- The corresponding entities (sensors, meta-entity) are assigned to the respective device.
- The integration imports consumption data step by step and maintains metadata such as contract start and last import.

## History
- Initially, an attempt was made to realize the import via the EKZ Energy Assistant. However, this required an additional add-on for login, which made setup more difficult.
- Afterwards, the original ekz-ha GitHub repository was found and a fork was created to improve the integration and adapt it to personal requirements. This repository is the result of that work.
- The integration was extended so that a separate device is created for each installation ID and all related entities refer to it.

## Notes
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) at EKZ must be disabled for login to work.
- The integration is optimized for use in Home Assistant and is regularly improved.

## Credits
- Based on the original repository by [stefanloerwald/ekz-ha](https://github.com/stefanloerwald/ekz-ha).
- Further developed and adapted by dmoo500.
